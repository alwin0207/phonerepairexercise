This is a design exercise (It was not meant to be fully functional).

My goals while making this project:

1. How to make my layouts more visual attractive, as i'm not a visual designer.
2. How to use color. (not in a functional way, as contrast could be done better).
3. Finding out if i can easily use css for styling.
4. Learning to work with grid and flexbox.
5. How far can i go without using javascript(this forces me to learn more features in html and css).


As this page is only created as an exercise i still have a to do list for a better real life version:

1. clean up the code. (while experimenting the code became a mess. This would be the next step for a more functional product).
2. Make the site responsive. Change the code for especialy the gsm/laptop repair blocks as those are the least responsive.
3. Check layout at different widths and heights to check for boundaries of the layout.
4. Make an alternative layout for mobile and check for layout optimalization so you need less code.
5. Add footer content.
6. Change layout of the top image as the button is still kinda lonely and off.
7. Look for a more logical placement of the content. 
8. Add links
9. Add more content (like the shop, sale items, news)
